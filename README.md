This is my first project from the Odin Project. I will be creating a simple website using VSCode and uploading to GitHub. By the end of this, I should be confident in the creation of a simple website and the process of uploading a Project. 
I will be committing regularly too.
I will update this README file at the end of my project to reflect on my experience.

Well, that was fun! I spent a while trying to figure out a typo that was stopping one of my pages from linking correctly from the index. 

I also learned that it made sense to copy and paste the whole code from each recipe page to a new recipe page and then fill in new details within the code, rather than risk formatting each page slightly differently.
